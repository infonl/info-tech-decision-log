# INFO Technical Decision Log

This repository contains the overall INFO technical decision log. It contains high-level technical decisions that we wish to make public as a company. It serves as an companion to our [INFO Technology Radar](https://infonl.github.io/info-techradar/index.html) by providing more details about certain technical decisions.

## How to use

We use the [log4brains](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains) Architectural Decision Record (ADR) tool to manage and publish our technical decisions.

The INFO tech leadership team is end-responsible for maintaining these decisions but we encourage anyone at INFO to review and contribute.
